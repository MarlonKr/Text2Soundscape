I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not able to provide MIDI files or use external libraries like MIDIUtil. However, I can provide a list of tuples that represents a melody in the format you specified. Here's an example melody that matches the description you provided:

melody = [(60, 100, 2), (62, 100, 1), (64, 100, 1), (65, 100, 2), (67, 100, 1), (69, 100, 1), (71, 100, 2), (72, 100, 1), (74, 100, 1), (76, 100, 2), (77, 100, 1), (79, 100, 1), (81, 100, 2), (83, 100, 1), (84, 100, 1), (86, 100, 2), (88, 100, 1), (89, 100, 1), (91, 100, 2), (93, 100, 1), (95, 100, 1), (97, 100, 2), (98, 100, 1), (100, 100, 1), (102, 100, 2), (103, 100, 1), (105, 100, 1), (107, 100, 2), (109, 100, 1), (111, 100, 1), (113, 100, 2), (114, 100, 1), (116, 100, 1), (118, 100, 2), (119, 100, 1), (121, 100, 1), (123, 100, 2), (124, 100, 1), (126, 100, 1), (127, 100, 2)]

In this melody, the pitch values range from 60 to 127, representing notes in the C major scale. The velocity is set to 100 for all notes, indicating a consistent intensity throughout the melody. The duration values range from 1 to 2, with shorter notes creating a sense of speed and intricate passages, while longer notes provide moments of rest and build-up to the next section.
